                            <h2>What is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu?</h2>
                            <p>Roughly translating to "the gentle way" in Japanese, Jiu Jitsu is a martial art/fighting system that focuses on grappling, and especially ground fighting. BJJ promotes the concept that a smaller, weaker person can succesfully defend against a bigger, stronger assailaint by using proper technique, leverage, and most notably taking the fight to the ground, and then applying joint-locks and chokeholds to defeat the opponent.</p>

    <h2>Primary Ground Positions</h2>
        <h4>Side Control</h4>
            <img class="displayed" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Udegarami.JPG" width="250" height="250">
            <p>In side control, the practitioner pins his opponent to the ground from the side of his body. The dominant grappler lies across the opponent with weight applied to the opponent's chest. The opponent may be further controlled by pressure on either side of the shoulders and hips from the practitioner's elbows, shoulders, and knees. A wide variety of submissions are initiated from side control. It is also referred to as the side mount. Additionally, the typical side mount increases opportunity for the dominant grappler to advance to a more dominant and less used type of side control known as the mounted crucifix position. In this position, the dominant grappler has his body at the very top of the opponent's torso, one arm controlled between both of the top grappler's arms, and the other arm trapped between the legs. This position is most used in MMA as it allows the dominant fighter to strike whilst taking away their opponents defence. Submission options are limited however and so this position is rarely used in BJJ competition. Variants of the side control include Twister Side Control (popularized by Eddie Bravo), Brazilian Crossbody, Kesa Gatame, "Wrestler Pin" and knee mount.</p>

        <h4>Full Mount</h4>
            <img class="displayed" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Andrea_Galvao.jpg" height="250" width="250">
            <p>In the mount position, the practitioner sits astride the opponent's chest, controlling the opponent with his bodyweight and hips. In the strongest form of this position, the practitioner works his knees into the opponent's arm pits to reduce arm movements and ability to move or counter the submission attempts. Full Mount can be used to apply armlocks or chokes.</p>

        <h4>Back Mount</h4>
            <img class="displayed" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/U.S._Army_Staff_Sgt._Israel_Guerrero%2C_blue_belt%2C_competes_against_Staff_Sgt._Joshua_Allen_during_the_Modern_Army_Combatives_tournament_of_the_2013_Army_Reserve_Best_Warrior_Competition_at_Fort_McCoy%2C_Wis_130627-A-EA829-464.jpg" height="250" width="250">
            <p>When using the back mount (often known in Brazilian jiu-jitsu as the back grab or attacking the back), the practitioner attaches to the back of the opponent by wrapping his legs around and hooking the opponent's thighs with his heels or locking in a body triangle by crossing one shin across the waist like a belt then placing the back of the opposing knee over the instep as if finishing a triangle choke. Simultaneously, the upper body is controlled by wrapping the arms around the chest or neck of the opponent. This position is often used to apply chokeholds, and counters much of the benefit an opponent may have from greater size or strength.</p>

        <h4>Guard</h4>
            <p>In the Guard, the practitioner is on his back controlling an opponent with his legs. The practitioner pushes and pulls with the legs or feet to upset the balance and limit the movements of his opponent. This position comes into play often when an opponent manages to place the practitioner upon his back and the practitioner seeks the best position possible to launch counter-attacks. This is a very versatile position from which the BJJ practitioner can attempt to sweep (reverse) the opponent, get back to the feet, or apply a variety of joint locks as well as various chokes.

<br>The three main types of guard are Closed Guard, Half Guard, and Open Guard.<br>
   <br><img class="displayed" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Brazilian_Jiu-jitsu-Closed_guard.jpg" height="250" width="250">
<br>In closed guard, the bottom grappler has his legs around the opponent's trunk, and ankles closed together to provide control and a barrier to escaping the position. The closed guard is a very powerful guard seen often in MMA style tournaments because of amount of control it gives the bottom fighter and lack of necessity for grips to control top opponent and block his strikes. This guard allow many setups for submissions such as jointlocks and chokes as well as great opportunities for reversing the opponent into the very dominant fully mounted position.<br>
    <br><img class="displayed" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/MCRP3-02Bfig7-1guard.png" height="250" width="250">
<br>In the open guard, the legs are not hooked together and the bottom grappler uses his legs or feet to push or pull in a more dynamic fashion. There are many variations of open guard with distinct names and positioning including the Butterfly Guard, De La Riva Guard, X-Guard, Spider Guard, Lapel Guard, and even the newly emerging Worm Guard made popular by Keenan Cornelius. Butterfly guard is when the bottom grappler brings his legs up and feet together against the inner thighs of top opponent. The name is derived from the resulting butterfly wing shape. Butterfly guard increases both space to maneuver and the ability counter the opponent with the shins or arches of the feet against the competitor's inner thighs.<br>
    <br><img class="displayed" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c4/Half_guard_in_Brazilian_Jiu-Jitsu.jpg" height="250" width="250">
<br>In the half guard, one of the top grappler's legs is controlled by the bottom grappler's legs, blocking the top opponent from achieving the side control or full mount positions. There is also a variant of Half-Guard called 50/50 Guard, which consist of each opponent usually in sitting positions with one of their legs hooking the same leg of their opponent in a mirrored fashion. This position is called 50/50, because neither opponent has a distinct advantage with both sides have the same possibilities of sweeps and attacks.</p>

    <h4>Submission</h4>
        <img class="displayed" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/In-guard_armbar.jpg" height="250" width="250">
        <p>The majority of submission holds can be grouped into two broad categories: joint locks and chokes. Joint locks typically involve isolating an opponent's limb and creating a lever with the body position which will force the joint to move past its normal range of motion. Pressure is increased in a controlled manner and released if the opponent cannot escape the hold and signals defeat by submitting (usually with a tap).  A choke hold, by disrupting the blood supply to the brain, can cause unconsciousness if the opponent does not submit soon enough.</p>
    <h2>Belt System</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>White Belt</li>
            <li>Blue Belt</li>
            <li>Purple Belt</li>
            <li>Brown Belt</li>
            <li>Black Belt</li>
        </ol>
            <p>The Brazilian jiu-jitsu ranking system awards a practitioner different colored belts to signify increasing levels of technical knowledge and practical skill. While the system's structure shares its origins with the judo ranking system and the origins of all colored belts, it now contains many of its own unique aspects and themes. Some of these differences are relatively minor, such as the division between youth and adult belts and the stripe/degree system. Others are quite distinct and have become synonymous with the art, such as a marked informality in promotional criteria, including as a focus on a competitive demonstration of skill, and a conservative approach to promotion in general. The amount of time it takes to achieve the rank of black belt varies between the individual but the average time frame is between 8 and 12 years with a consistent training schedule.</p>
